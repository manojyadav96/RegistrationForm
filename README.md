The RegistrationForm.js file is a React component that renders a registration form. The form has four fields: full name, email, password, and password strength. The form is validated when the user clicks the "Register" button. If all fields are valid, the user is registered and a toast message is displayed.

The following is a step-by-step explanation of the code in the RegistrationForm.js file:

1. The `useState` hook is used to create state variables for the full name, email, password, and password strength fields.
2. The `FormControl` component is used to render each field. The `isRequired` prop is used to make each field required. The `isInvalid` prop is used to show an error message if the field is invalid.
3. The `Input` component is used to render the text input fields for the full name, email, and password fields. The `onChange` prop is used to update the state variables when the user changes the value of the input field.
4. The `FormErrorMessage` component is used to render an error message if the field is invalid.
5. The `handlePasswordChange` function is used to update the password strength state variable when the user changes the value of the password field.
6. The `handleRegister` function is used to simulate registration. A toast message is displayed to indicate that the user has been registered.
7. The `Box` component is used to wrap the form and give it some styling.
